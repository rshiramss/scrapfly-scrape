It’s impossible to leave this country without feeling inspired and full of new ideas.This trip marked the first time the \n      \n  ’s Board of Trustees met outside of Seattle, and there was no better place for our board of trustees to meet and celebrate 25 years. It was especially meaningful to meet with our partners in the country, see the programs we’ve supported up close, reflect on our long history of working with India—and look ahead at what’s next.  As always, I was blown away by the progress India has made—even in the year since I last visited—especially in its work to advance AI-powered innovation, digital public infrastructure, health, and agricultural development. It’s clear that this country’s impact doesn’t stop at its borders—it extends and improves lives around the world.  Here are a few pictures from my visit.I played some —why choose one sport when you can play both?—with my friend \n      \n   to celebrate the Gates Foundation’s new partnership with the Sachin Tendulkar Foundation. We’re hopeful that this collaboration will make a meaningful impact across health, nutrition, and education.This year marks the \n      \n  ’s 25th anniversary, and it was wonderful to celebrate the occasion with our incredible team and partners in India. We reflected on some of the country’s greatest achievements over the past few decades—including expanded healthcare access, stronger agricultural systems, improved sanitation, and increased opportunities for women. The excitement in the room was contagious.  It’s always great to sit down and talk with Prime Minister \n      \n  . We had an engaging discussion about India’s development and plans for the future, including his vision of Viksit Bharat 2047. The transformative work happening in India isn’t just improving lives locally—it's driving progress around the world.I visited the \n      \n  , where I learned about groundbreaking innovations in development—including fetal monitoring systems and real-time tuberculosis detection tools.It was an honor to meet with government leaders who are championing programs that advance financial inclusion, clean energy, AI and digital public infrastructure, agri-tech, and public health. Our conversations were inspiring and reinforced my belief in what’s possible when big challenges are matched by even bigger ambitions.This trip deepened my understanding of how India’s innovations are reshaping not just the country, but the world. It was a reminder of what can happen when leadership, bold ideas, and collaboration come together to improve lives at scale. I’m heading home energized—and eager to see what India makes possible next.See you next time, India."

    "articleBody": "I was excited to get a drone for my birthday last year. I couldn’t wait to get it into the air and see what my backyard looked like from the sky. But, as anyone who has used one can tell you, I quickly learned a harsh truth: Flying a drone isn’t easy. It takes a lot of practice and skill.Maybe it’s time to pull the drone back out, because I was lucky to get a lesson from the experts last month in India. During my visit to Delhi, I met with Sangita Devi, Sumintra Devi, and Kajol Kumari—three Drone Didis from Bihar who are taking India’s agricultural productivity to new heights.The women I met are part of the Indian government’s . (Didi is the Hindi word for “sister.”) It was launched in 2023 to help rural women boost their income and boost India’s agricultural productivity—and although the program is still in its early days, I’m already impressed by its results.Right now, the Drone Didis primarily use their flying skills to fertilize crops. Applying fertilizer via drone has a lot of benefits over doing it by hand. Since you can spray farther away from the plant, the liquid fertilizer becomes more atomized—which means that it turns into finer droplets that cover more area. This benefits both farmers and the environment, because you need significantly less fertilizer and less water to help distribute it. Plus, it’s faster. One Drone Didi can cover as much as five acres in the same time it would take five people to cover half an acre.I cannot wait to see how the program expands in the years ahead. The Indian government has plans to equip the drones with advanced sensors and imaging technology. This will allow Drone Didis to use real-time data to deliver targeted interventions to improve the quality and quantity of farmers’ crops. They will be able to detect diseases and pests, assess soil moisture levels, monitor crop growth, and more.I’m equally excited to track how the Drone Didi program continues to empower women across India. Every Didi is affiliated with a self-help group, or SHG. The plan is to provide nearly 15,000 drones to SHGs across India by the end of next year.In the United States, where I live, self-help groups are usually associated with mental health. In India, they’re a form of mutual aid. Each SHG is small—most are around 12 people, although some are as big as 25—and brings together women to support each other socially and financially. They pool their savings, access microloans at lower interest rates, and solve problems in areas like health and education.The Didis I met with were longtime members of SHGs organized by , an organization in Bihar that works to lift people from rural areas out of poverty. During our time together in Delhi, Kajol told me about how JEEViKA helped her open her own shop three years ago, where she sells seeds and fertilizers. She loves being an entrepreneur, and when she was approached about becoming a Drone Didi, she knew it would do wonders for her business.Each Didi attends a training program in Hyderabad or Noida, where they are taught how to pilot the drone and apply fertilizer effectively. (I was surprised to hear that learning to fly is apparently easier and takes less time than learning to fertilize!) Other women in their SHGs are trained as drone technicians, ready to repair the machines if any problems arise.In the less than two years, the Drone Didi program is already transforming the lives of its pilots. Kajol is using the extra income she’s earned to expand her shop offerings and build a warehouse to store her stock. She also plans to send her children to a better school. Sangita’s family couldn’t afford a bicycle before she became a Drone Didi—today, she is the proud owner of an auto rickshaw.Sumintra hopes that, when people see someone like her flying a huge drone, it changes their perception of what women are capable of. Like many women in her area, she married very young and was expected to stay home with her children. Today, her kids call her “Pilot Mummy” and dream about her flying airplanes one day.I hope you think of the Didis the next time you hear the buzz of a drone above you at a wedding or a park. It’s remarkable how one piece of technology can reshape what is possible in a community. Kajol told me that people sometimes look at her and say, “She’s flying too high! What will she do next?”Her response? “This is just the beginning. Wait and see what’s coming.”"

This will be my first time seeing everyone since  that I will give away virtually all of my wealth through the Gates Foundation over the next 20 years to save and improve lives around the world. Although it’s been many years since I left Microsoft, I am still a CEO at heart, and I don’t make any decisions about my money without considering the impact. I feel confident putting the remainder of my wealth into the Gates Foundation, because I know how brilliant and dedicated the people responsible for using that money are—and I can’t wait to celebrate them.I'm inspired by my colleagues at the foundation, many of whom have foregone more lucrative careers in the private sector to use their talents for the greater good. They possess what Andrew Carnegie called “precious generosity,” and the world is better off for it.I am lucky to have been surrounded by many generous people throughout my life. As I wrote in , my parents were my first and biggest influences. My mom introduced me to the idea of giving back. She was a big believer in the idea of “to whom much is given much is expected,” and she taught me that I was just a steward of any wealth I gained.Dad was a giant in every sense of the word, and he, more than anyone else, shaped the values of the foundation as its first leader. He was collaborative, judicious, and serious about learning—three qualities that shape our approach to everything we do. Every year, the most important internal recognition we hand out is called the Bill Sr. Award, which goes to the staff member who most exemplifies the values that he stood for. Everything we have accomplished—and will accomplish—is a testament to his vision of a better world.As an adult, one of my biggest influences has been Warren Buffett, who remains the ultimate model of generosity. He was the first one who introduced me to the idea of giving everything away, and he’s been incredibly generous to the foundation over the decades.  remains a big hero of mine, and his philosophy of “giving while living” has shaped how I think about philanthropy.I hope other wealthy people consider how much they can accelerate progress for the world’s poorest if they increased the pace and scale of their giving, because it is such a profoundly impactful way to give back to society. I feel fulfilled every day I go to work at the foundation. It forces me to learn new things, and I get to work with incredible people out in the field who really understand how to maximize the impact of new tools.Today’s announcement almost certainly marks the beginning of the last chapter of my career, and I’m okay with that. I have come a long way since I was just a kid starting a software company with my friend from middle school. As Microsoft turns 50 years old, it feels right that I celebrate the milestone by committing to give away the resources I earned through the company.A lot can happen over the course of twenty years. I want to make sure the world moves forward during that time. The clock starts now—and I can’t wait to make the most of it."
